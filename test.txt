In a university very far away, four friends - Sarah, Mark, Alex, and Emily - embarked on a project to create a client-server application using Node.js. Their goal was to build a chat application. Mark designed the client's user-friendly interface, while Alex set up the server using Node.js's 'net' module. Sarah coded the server's functionality and error handling, and Emily focused on the user experience.
Challenges included handling concurrency and rigorous testing. During the presentation, they showcased their real-time chat application, impressing their professor and classmates. This project not only earned them a great grade but also valuable experience in Node.js development, opening doors to future coding adventures.
